=========================================

We are Reel News! Our mission is to make news unbiased for the masses by implementing a data-driven approach using Google Trends. Currently, users rely on social media/entertainment platforms such as TikTok, YouTube, Facebook, and X (fka Twitter) to get their news. Unfortunately, these applications have filtering algorithms that restrict users in viewing content relating to their topic(s) of interest. We believe this trajectory is toxic & inhibits users to keep an openmind of understanding others' perspectives plus understand other aspects of the world that they haven't experienced before!

At this stage, we're showcasing how the application's database works in SQL!

Check out our sample queries...Query 1 (search top results on 2025-04-20 in the cities LA, SF, OAK, SJ, SAC, ST, MOD), Query 2 (top rising terms), Query 3 (), Query 4 (), Query 5 (), Query 6 ()!


Cheers!
